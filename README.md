# Goofy_person_recognition
A short python code for raspberry pi 5 which turns on an LED and plays a goofy sound when a person is detected by a camera. Uses the mobilenet CNN.

This code is originally from the examples section of the picamera2 library package, which was modified to be a bit goofy. Enjoy!
